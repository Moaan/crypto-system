Greetings Agent Kyle,

We are glad to hear you have not been compromised by the leak.
Stay low for a three days and then proceed into the city. We have provided contacts for you
at the Hollow Bastion Inn on 162nd street. Make sure you follow protocols strictly from now on.
Good luck and God speed.

-Sgt. Henry G. Miller
